    Used as the abstract base-class for classes/object that communicate with our REST API.

    This is one of the main classes, and it's highly recommend you read the
    [SDK Library Overview](./#orm-library-overview) first, if you have not already.
    That document has many basic examples of using this class along with other related classes.

    Attributes that start with `_` or don't have a type-hint are not considered fields
    on the object that automatically get mapped to/from the JSON that is passed in.
    For more details see [Type Hints](./#type-hints).

    When you sub-class `BaseModel`, you can create your own Model class, with your own
    fields/attrs.
    You can pass class arguments/paramters in when you declare your sub-class.
    The Model-subclass can provide parameters to the super class during class construction.

    In the example below, notice the `base_url` part. That's a class argument, that is used by the
    super-class during the construction of the sub-class (before any instances are created).
    In this case it takes this and stores it on
    `xmodel.rest.RestStructure.base_model_url`
    as part of the structure information for the `BaseModel` subclass.

    See [Basic Model Example](./#basic-model-example) for an example of what class arguments
    are or look at this example below using a RestModel:

    >>> # 'base_url' part is a class argument:
    >>> from xmodel.rest import RestModel
    >>> class Account(RestModel["Account"], base_url='/account'):
    >>>    id: str
    >>>    name: str

    These class arguments are sent to a special method
    `xmodel.base.structure.BaseStructure.configure_for_model_type`. See that methods docs for
    a list of avaliable class-arguments.

    See `BaseModel.__init_subclass__` for more on the internal details of how this works exactly.

    .. note:: In the case of `base_url` example above, it's the base-url-endpoint for the model.
        If you want to know more about that see `xmodel.rest.RestClient.url_for_endpoint`.
        It has details on how the final request `xurls.url.Url` is constructed.

    This class also allows you to more easily with with JSON data via:

    - `xmodel.base.api.BaseApi.json`
    - `xmodel.base.api.BaseApi.update_from_json`
    - Or passing a JSON dict as the first arrument to `BaseModel.__init__`.

    Other important related classes are listed below.

    - `xmodel.base.api.BaseApi` Accessable via `BaseModel.api`.
    - `xmodel.rest.RestClient`: Accessable via `xmodel.base.api.BaseApi.client`.
    - `xmodel.rest.settings.RestSettings`: Accessable via
        `xmodel.base.api.BaseApi.settings`.
    - `xmodel.base.structure.BaseStructure`: Accessable via
        `xmodel.base.api.BaseApi.structure`
    - `xmodel.base.auth.BaseAuth`: Accessable via `xmodel.base.api.BaseApi.auth`

    .. tip:: For all of the above, you can change what class is allocated for each one
        by changing the type-hint on a subclass.

        """
        We take all arguments (except `lazy_loader`) passed into here and send them to the method
        on our structure:
        `xmodel.base.structure.BaseStructure.configure_for_model_type`.
        This allows you to easily configure the BaseStructure via class arguments.

        For a list of class-arguments, see method parameters for
        `xmodel.base.structure.BaseStructure.configure_for_model_type`.

        See [Basic BaseModel Example](./#basic-model-example) for an example of what class
        arguments are for `BaseModel` classes and how to use them.

        We lazily configure BaseModel sub-classes. They are configured the first time that
        `BaseModel.api` is accessed under that subclass. At that point all parent + that specific
        subclass are configured and an `xmodel.base.api.BaseApi` object is created and set
        on the `BaseModel.api` attribute. From that point forward, that object is what is used.
        This only happens the first time that `BaseModel.api` is accessed.

        If you want to add support for additional BaseModel class arguments,
        you can do it by modifying the base-implementation
        `xmodel.base.structure.BaseStructure`.
        Or if you want it only for a specific sub-set of Models, you can make a custom
        `xmodel.base.structure.BaseStructure` subclass. You can configure your BaseModel to use
        this BaseStructure subclass via a type-hint on `xmodel.base.api.BaseApi.structure`.

        See `xdynamo.dynamo.DynStructure.configure_for_model_type` for a complete example of a
        custom BaseStructure subclass that adds extra class arguments that are specific to Dynamo.

        Args:
            lazy_loader: This is a callable where the first argument is `cls/self`.
                This is an optional param. If provided, we will call when we need to lazy-load
                but before we do our normal lazy-loading ourselves here.

                Most of the time, you'll want to import into the global/module space of where
                your class lives any imports you need to do lazily, such as circular imports.

                Right after we call your lazy_loader callable, we will be ourselves calling
                the method `get_type_hints` to get all of our type-hints.
                You'll want to be sure all of your forward-referenced type-hints on your
                model sub-class are resolvable.

                Forward-ref type hints are the ones that are string based type-hints,
                they get resolved lazily after your lazy_loader (if provided) is called.

                You can see in the code in our method below, look at the check for:

                >>> if "BaseApi" not in globals():

                Look at that for a real-world example of what I am talking about.
                This little piece of code lazily resolves the `BaseApi` type.
