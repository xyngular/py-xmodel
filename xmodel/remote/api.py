            We figure out the proper client object to use based on the type-hint for "client"
            property on the sub-class.

            Example:

                >>> from typing import TypeVar
                >>> from xmodel import RestApi, RestClient
                >>> M = TypeVar("M")  # <-- This allows IDE to do better code completion.
                >>>
                >>> class MyClient(RestClient[M]):
                >>>     pass
                >>>
                >>> class MyApi(RestApi[M])
                >>>     client: MyClient[M]  # <-- Type hint on 'client' property.

            This is enough for `xmodel.base.BaseModel` subclasses that have this set as their
            api type-hint:

                >>> from xmodel.remote.model import RemoteModel
                >>>
                >>> class MyModel(RemoteModel):
                >>>     api: MyApi

            When you get MyModel's api like below, it will return a MyApi instance,
            MyApi will in turn return a MyClient:

                >>> print(MyModel.api)
                MyApi(...)
                >>> print(MyModel.api.client)
                MyClient(...)

            For a more concreate use/example, see `xmodel_rest.RestModel`;
            it's a RemoteModel subclass that implments a RestClient that can be used with it.

        """
        This method would have probably been better named `get_via_key`.

        The idea with this method is you pass in an value that can be queried against and
        id/key type of field that should always and ONLY identify zero or one objects.
        We will be using this fact to assume we can cache/map the id to a value we get so
        future requests will just return the existing object.

        If you give us a list for `id` then we will return a list/generator.
        Important: Right now we return a list in this case.
        But it might be just a generator in the future,
        treat the return type as a true Iterable, something you can't call 'len(...)' on.

        Get object via it's ID or a composite-key from API.
        If you pass in a list instead of an int/str for id, then this will return a list
        for all objects for objects found for passed in id's.
        We will automatically split up the requests in this case so they don't get too big and
        combine the results later and return a list (or a generator in the future).

        If you pass in a dictionary it will formulate the query to include all fields and values
        included in the dict.

        If you pass in a list of Dict's it will process all of the dictionaries and group
        them together where the keys in the dictionary match each other such as:
        [{key: 1}, {key:2}, {key:3, value:1}]
        would be grouped into queries:
        query 1 = {key: [1,2]}
        query 2 = {key: [3], value: [1]}
        and then process each query individually.

        .. attention:: If we ever have an API that can't accept multiple values for a key
            like we show in the above example; we would need to send each item in the list
            in individual requests.  Need to add support for that when we need it.

        This method is nice to use vs doing a generic query with the id/key, due to the fact
        we will look for cached object if the sub-class has the cache ny id enabled.
        This will also chunk queries so that no url will be too long for an api to handle.

        See `RelationApi.get` for a description of how 'fields` param works.

        Args:
            id: The identifier(s) of object to get.
            fields: See `RelationApi.get` for more info on how fields work.
                Summary: Try to only retrieve named fields (by default, we get all fields).
            id_field: If None, uses default 'id' field name, otherwise uses one provided.
            aux_query: If not None: Adds these to the query that is sent to API.

                Whatever is in this `aux_query` is added to each request for each of the
                identifiers provided in the 'id' parameter.

                Sometimes we can query for several identifiers per-request, sometimes not.
                Regardless of how we decide to breakup multiple 'id' values we will always
                add this `aux_query` to it.

                Used to provide additional filtering criteria in addition to the 'id'.

                You might want to get a set of objects by id, that also have (as an example)
                their 'first_name' attribute set to 'Josh', for example.
                Consider that we could pass thousands up ID's into a request,
                this could be a much faster way to get specific objects back then grabbing
                all of them and checking the `first_name` attribute yourself if you expect
                only a few of these objects to actually match.

                These won't be split up into segments [to keep Url/Request smaller] like the
                id/keys are.
                We are not able to use the id-cache if these are provided, we may always have
                to go to the API. This may change at some point in the future [by executing the
                query ourselves and not via the API against the cached objects]. But for now
                that's not the case.

            .. important:: aux_query is also only currently used if you pass in a `list`
                as the `id`. At some point we support non-id-list based aux_query.

            .. todo:: Consider using 'aux_query' against previously cached items.
